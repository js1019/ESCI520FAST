\section{Template matching}
we use templates with high SNR to cross-correlate with the continuous data to detect other events. The Figure \ref{fig:method} shows one example of this method.

\end{figure}
  In this project, we use 14 templates and detect 22 events. Among the 22 events, there are 8 events can obviously observed.
