freq_sac.c is used for calculating the cross-correlation coefficient between the template and the continuous contwave.
freq_ps.c is used for detecting the events based on the threshold.
ccFreqRM.c is the subfunction for calculating the cross-correlation coefficient. 
comThreshold.c is the subfunction for calculating the threshold.
