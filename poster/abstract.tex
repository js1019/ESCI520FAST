Recent advances in seismic data acquisition by dense arrays driven by the requirement for new information are providing large volumes of the waveform records. 
The growth and complications of modern high-quality seismic data challenge the standard techniques for extracting useful signals. 
To overcome the limitations of the traditional methods, 
we study and exploit several data mining approaches, including template matching, efficient similarity search, and deep learning.

Our study aims at the effective and robust detection of different seismic signals. 
The development of the new computing paradigms has the potential to improve seismic monitoring and understand the microseismicity.
